# 🛠️ Task 1: RISC-V Toolchain Setup and Verification Using WSL 



## 🎯 Objective

Successfully install the RISC-V toolchain in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), configure the environment variables, and verify that the essential binaries (`gcc`, `objdump`, and `gdb`) function correctly for cross-compilation development.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) installed and configured
- ✅ Downloaded `riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-ubuntu.tar.gz` in Windows Downloads directory
- ✅ Basic knowledge of Linux command line operations

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Navigate to Downloads Directory and Create Installation Path

Access the Windows Downloads directory from WSL and prepare the installation directory.
 Navigate to Windows Downloads directory from WSL
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/rsdsr/Downloads
```

Create installation directory with proper permissions
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/riscv
```

Verify the downloaded toolchain archive exists
```bash
ls -la riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-ubuntu.tar.gz
```


### Step 2: Extract the RISC-V Toolchain

Extract the downloaded toolchain archive to the designated installation directory.

Extract the toolchain archive to /opt/riscv
```bash
sudo tar -xzf riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-ubuntu.tar.gz -C /opt/riscv --strip-components=1
```
Verify extraction was successful
```bash
ls -la /opt/riscv/
```
Check the nested directory structure (important for PATH configuration)
```bash
ls -la /opt/riscv/riscv/
```

### Step 3: Configure PATH Environment Variable

Add the RISC-V toolchain binaries to the system PATH for persistent access.

Add toolchain binaries to PATH (note the nested riscv/riscv/bin structure)
```bash
echo 'export PATH=/opt/riscv/riscv/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```
Reload the shell configuration to apply changes
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
Verify PATH configuration
```bash
echo $PATH | grep riscv
```


### Step 4: Verify Toolchain Installation

Test all essential RISC-V development tools to ensure proper installation and functionality.

Check GCC compiler version
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc --version
```
Check objdump utility version
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump --version
```

Check GDB debugger version
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb --version
```

Verify target architecture support
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -dumpmachine
```

List all available RISC-V binaries
```bash
ls -la /opt/riscv/riscv/bin/ | grep riscv32
```


## 📊 Expected Results

Upon successful completion, you should see output similar to:

- **GCC Version**: `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc (g04696df096) 14.2.0`
- **Target Architecture**: `riscv32-unknown-elf`
- **Total Binaries**: 64 RISC-V development tools available
- **ISA Support**: `rv32i2p1_m2p0_a2p1_c2p0` (RV32IMAC)

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions:

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `command not found` | Incorrect PATH configuration | Verify PATH points to `/opt/riscv/riscv/bin` |
| Permission denied | Insufficient permissions | Use `sudo` for operations in `/opt/riscv` |
| Multiple PATH entries | Repeated exports in `.bashrc` | Clean up `.bashrc` manually |
| Extraction errors | Corrupted download | Re-download the toolchain archive |

# 🏗️ Task 2: Cross-Compile "Hello, RISC-V"

## 🎯 Objective

Create a minimal C "Hello World" program and successfully cross-compile it for the RISC-V RV32 architecture, producing a valid 32-bit RISC-V ELF executable that demonstrates proper toolchain functionality.[1][4]

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ RISC-V toolchain installed and configured (Task 1 completed)
- ✅ PATH environment variable set to `/opt/riscv/riscv/bin`
- ✅ Verified `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc` functionality
- ✅ Basic understanding of C programming and cross-compilation concepts

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Create the Hello World C Program

Create a minimal C program that demonstrates basic functionality and printf usage.
```bash
nano hello.c
```

**C Program Code:**
```bash
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
printf("Hello, RISC-V!\n");
return 0;
}
```

### Step 2: Cross-Compile for RISC-V Architecture
Compile the C program using the RISC-V toolchain with the default configuration that works with your specific toolchain setup.

 Cross-compile using default toolchain configuration (THIS WORKS!)
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -o hello.elf hello.c
```
✅ Working Solution: Use default compilation without explicit -march or -mabi flags to avoid multilib errors.

### Step 3: Verify the Compiled ELF Binary
Check that the compiled binary is a valid 32-bit RISC-V executable.
```bash
# Check the ELF file properties and architecture
file hello.elf
```
✅ Expected Working Output:

```bash
hello.elf: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, UCB RISC-V, RVC, soft-float ABI, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
```
### Step 4: Additional Working Verification Commands

 Check file exists and basic properties
```bash
ls -la hello.elf
```

 Verify target architecture
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -dumpmachine
```

Basic objdump header check
```bash riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -h hello.elf
```
📊 Confirmed Working Results
Your Successful Output:
✅ 32-bit RISC-V: Correct target architecture confirmed

✅ RVC: Compressed instructions enabled (equivalent to rv32imc)

✅ Statically linked: Self-contained executable

✅ UCB RISC-V: Standard RISC-V specification

✅ GCC Version: 14.2.0 (g04696df096) working properly

Technical Specifications That Work:
Target: riscv32-unknown-elf

Toolchain Path: /opt/riscv/riscv/bin/

Default ISA: Automatically includes RV32IMAC support

Compilation Method: Default configuration (no explicit flags needed)

🚫 What NOT to Use (Causes Errors):
```bash
# ❌ AVOID - Causes multilib errors in your setup:
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -march=rv32imc -mabi=ilp32 -o hello.elf hello.c

# ❌ AVOID - Explicit ISA flags incompatible with your toolchain:
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -march=rv32i -mabi=ilp32 -o hello.elf hello.c
```
✅ Success Criteria Met:
 Compilation completes without errors

 Generated hello.elf is valid 32-bit RISC-V executable

 file command shows "UCB RISC-V, RVC"

 Binary ready for Task 3 assembly analysis
